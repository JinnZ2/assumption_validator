## Cloning and pushing
Shallow clones are single-branch by default.
Before pushing any branch other than the default
branch, run:

    git config remote.origin.fetch '+refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*'
    git fetch --depth 1

Or clone with: git clone --depth 1 --no-single-branch <url>
Without this, the first push of a new branch
fails the tracking-ref check even when the
commit landed.
